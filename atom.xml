<h3>Short answer</h3>

<p>I got started by reading the following book :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Edition-Guides/dp/0321942051">iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a></p>

<p>But obviously it&rsquo;s not enough to go from zero to hero, you need to read other books, but for learning the basics regarding iOS it&rsquo;s a pretty awesome start !</p>

<h3>Long Answer</h3>

<p>I actually ordered the book from Amazon, it took an entire month to arrive then I started reading chapter by chapter, what I usually do to learn anything is read the chapter with my computer shutdown, that forces my brain to focus on what I&rsquo;m reading and force it to remember what I&rsquo;m remember and make the necessary links between the concepts and all &hellip; then after I finish reading the chapter, at that point I go and practice whatever they&rsquo;re built in the chapter, basically I try to type the code snippets they have there, but it depends on if I have enough time to do so &hellip;</p>

<p>Also downloading the source code from their website can be good if you make sure to really understand how it&rsquo;s working, and the best way to do that is to play with it, like really mess the whole thing up and fix it whatever mess you did until you get it working again, that you know that you kinda understand 1% of whatever you have!</p>

<p>Practice is very important, also getting stuck, ans hitting your head with the wall, I mean it hurts, but that&rsquo;s how you get rid of the psychological barrier of thinking that you can&rsquo;t learn &hellip;</p>
